                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Hi, I'm Nino Vekua, a 17-year-old from Akhali Khibula. I'm currently an entrant and working hard to
                     finish school in the next year. My main goal right now is to excel in my studies and achieve great 
                     results in the national exams so that I can pursue my dream of becoming a student. I am passionate
                     about learning and dedicated to achieving success in everything I do.</p>

                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Hi, I'm Nino Vekua. I'm a tall, blonde girl with an energetic spirit, always ready to sing, dance, and find
                            joy in everything around me. I believe in staying positive and looking for the good in every situation.
                            While I love being lively and bringing smiles to others, I also have my moments of vulnerability. In
                            private, I sometimes struggle with stress and can get emotional, often questioning myself, but I always
                            find my way back to a better mood. <br>
                            <br>
                            One of my favorite hobbies is capturing memories and emotions through video. I take videos of
                            everything—parties, meetups, and just random moments—with my phone. These videos aren't for 
                            public sharing; I have private Instagram "spam" accounts where I store them, just for me and a small 
                            circle of follower. <br>
                            <br>
                            I'm someone who values supporting others—especially during their tough times—and I'm lucky to 
                            have a close-knit circle of friends and one amazing brother. Despite facing challenges with some of 
                            the people I trust, I remain committed to being kind and understanding.</p>
